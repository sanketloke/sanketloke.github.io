 Starting a blog here! The hope/purpose for starting the blog is three-fold:  discuss ideas from the research I have done and read,  flesh them out on the paper to clearly understand them and work towards the code whenever possible.

 I will begin by fleshing out the details of the project and recent papers i read.

<h3 id="orderedlist">Blog Targets</h3>

<li>Object Recognition from Local Scale-Invariant Features</li>

<li> ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</li>

<li>Object Recognition from Local Scale-Invariant Features</li>
