			We investigated an expanded version of Deep Q-Network where the reinforcement learning scheme is implemented to perform a
multi-agent task. In this approach, a new structure of neural network, the so called Deep Reinforcement Opponent Network (DRON) is made use of in order to model the Q network for the primal agent and the team and opponentsâ€™ policy simultaneously.
