	  <div style="text-align:justify">
	  Hi there! I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>, currently a masters graduate student at the Virginia Tech, where I'm studying computer science and machine learning. </br> </br> 
	  I have been working on vision research as a member of <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/people.html">Jia-Bin's Vision Lab </a>, since Spring 2017.

	  I also work as research assistant in the joint collaboration of <a href="http://dac.cs.vt.edu/"> Discovery Analytics Center(DAC) </a> and <a href="http://www.vtti.vt.edu/facilities/data-center.html"> Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI)  </a> on problems at the intersection of computer vision and transportation. </br> </br> 

	  I am jointly advised by <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/index.html">Prof. Jia-Bin Huang</a> and  <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/naren/">Prof. Naren Ramakrishnan </a>. My primary interests are in computer vision and machine learning. Currently, I am focused on improving generalizing capabilities of deep learnt representations trained over different domains.  </br> </br>

	  <!-- Since Spring 2017,  </br> </br> -->

	  In Spring 2017, I briefly experimented on possible improvements for siamese neural nets based visual tracking in videos with <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/index.html">Prof. Jia-Bin Huang</a>. </br> </br>

	  In Spring 2017, I worked with <a href="https://research.cs.vt.edu/3di/user/123" >Prof. Doug Bowman</a> on developing quarterback training environment in a motion-tracked Virtual Reality for American Football. In our user study, we asked questions on how prior experience with football affects the movement and decision-making in VE. [<a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/naren/">report </a>] [<a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/naren/">code </a>] </br> </br>

	  In Spring 2017, I was a tutor/teaching assistant for CS 3714: Mobile Software Development at VT. </br> </br>

	  In Fall 2016, I developed the initial prototype for learning deep agents on half-field offense task in a multi-agent soccer environment. The underlying model used by the agents is DQN with Opponent Modeling from He, He, et al. "Opponent Modeling in Deep Reinforcement Learning". [<a href="https://github.com/sanketloke/dlmultiagentsoccer">code </a>] [For more info, checkout the awesome <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/hausknecht_thesis/slides/thesis.pdf"> thesis </a> by Matthew Hausknecht] </br> </br>

	  In Fall 2016, I collaborated with <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/yuec/">Yue Cheng </a>, <a href="http://pratikone.github.io">Pratik Anand </a>, <a href="https://github.com/richasinha">Richa Sinha </a> and <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/butta/">Prof. Ali.R.Butt </a> , to develop optimizations in Redis targeted for reduction in memory usage for Redis, a key-value store database.

	  During 2015-16, I was a research intern at Indian Institute of Technology,Bombay, where I worked with Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan on two projects: natural language processing for taxonomy generation and development of an awesome ecosystem of apps for aggregating knowledge from farmers in rural India!
