	  <h4>Hi there! I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>, currently a masters graduate student at the Virginia Tech, where I'm studying computer science and mathematics(by transitive relation ). </br> </br> 
	  I work on research as a member of <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/people.html">Jia-Bin's Vision Lab </a> and also work as research assistant in the joint collaboration of <a href="http://dac.cs.vt.edu/"> Discovery Analytics Center(DAC) </a> and <a href="http://www.vtti.vt.edu/facilities/data-center.html"> Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) </a>. </br> </br> 

	  I am jointly advised by <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/index.html">Prof. Jia-Bin Huang</a> and  <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/naren/">Prof.Naren Ramakrishnan </a>. My primary interests are in computer vision and machine learning. Currently, I am focused on improving generalizing capabilities of deep learnt representations trained over different domains.  </br> </br> 

	  In graduate school, I have also dabbled in research of  <a href=""> key-value stores </a> and <a href=""> virtual environments</a>(VR).  </br> </br> 

	  I was a tutor/teaching assistant for CS 3714: Mobile Software Development at VT. </br> </br>  .

	  Outside of work, I enjoy  hiking , competitive programming , hacking stuff over the weekend and contributing to open source .</h4>
