		Hi there! I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>, currently a software engineer at Bloomberg. I graduated from Virginia Tech with Masters in Computer Science. As a masters student, I focused on computer vision research in <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/people.html"> Prof. Jia-Bin's Vision and Learning Lab </a>.
		  I was jointly advised by <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/index.html">Prof. Jia-Bin Huang</a> and  <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/naren/">Prof. Naren Ramakrishnan </a>. My <a href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/83513"> thesis </a> focused on developing a new continual learning method to alleviate catastrophic forgetting in incremental pixel-wise/dense labeling problems.   </br> </br>

	  <!-- Since Spring 2017,  </br> </br> -->
	
	  Fall 2018 : Joined Bloomberg as a Software Engineer!! </br> </br>

	  Spring 2018 : Graduated!!! Woohoo!! <a href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/83513"> Thesis : Continual Learning for Deep Dense Prediction	  </a> </br> </br>

	  Fall 2017 : Research Assistant under Prof. Jia-Bin. Developed the photogrammetry and iterative 3D reconstruction workflow for <a href="https://icat.vt.edu/icat_projects/source-form/">Source Form</a>, a tool to generate/print
	   3D models from subjective textual user input. </br> </br>

	  Fall 2017 : Proposed and developed constrained joint matrix factorization approach for game and user recommendation engine on <a href="https://steam.internet.byu.edu/">Steam gaming dataset </a> . Extended the algorithm for MapReduce Framework. </br> </br>

	  Summer 2017: Research Assistant under Prof. Naren at <a href="https://dac.cs.vt.edu/">Discovery Analytics Center</a> and <a href="https://www.vtti.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech Transportation Institute</a>. Analyzed and developed methods to detect driver fatigue/drowsiness and identify distracted drivers, using
	  dash-cam video and car sensors. </br> </br>

	  Spring 2017 : Researched on possible improvements for siamese neural nets based visual tracking in videos with <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/index.html">Prof. Jia-Bin Huang</a>. </br> </br>

	  Spring 2017 : Developed the first prototype for American football <a href=""></a>quarterback virtual reality/training environment
	  in a camera-tracked space (The Cube), with <a href="https://research.cs.vt.edu/3di/user/123" >Prof. Doug Bowman</a>. 
	  Checkout the awesome demo <a href="https://icat.vt.edu/icat_projects/embodied-virtual-reality-for-training-and-performance/">here</a>. </br></br>

	  Spring 2017 : Teaching assistant for CS 3714: Mobile Software Development at VT. </br> </br>

	  Fall 2016 : Researched and developed approches to learn deep agents on half-field offense task in a multi-agent soccer environment. The approach builds on the model by He, et al. "Opponent Modeling in Deep Reinforcement Learning". [<a href="https://github.com/sanketloke/dlmultiagentsoccer">Keras codebase</a>] [For more info, checkout the  <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/hausknecht_thesis/slides/thesis.pdf"> thesis </a> by Matthew Hausknecht] </br> </br>
